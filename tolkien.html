<p>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of all that I have seen<br>
of meadow-flowers and butterflies<br>
in summers that have been;
</p>
<p>
Of yellow leaves and gossamer<br>
in autumns that there were,<br>
with morning mist and silver sun<br>
and wind upon my hair.
</p>
<p>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of how the world will be<br>
when winter comes without a spring<br>
that I shall ever see.
</p>
<p>
For still there are so many things<br>
that I have never seen:<br>
in every wood in every spring<br>
there is a different green.<br>
</p>
<p>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of people long ago<br>
and people who will see a world<br>
that I shall never know.
</p>
<p>
But all the while I sit and think<br>
of times there were before,<br>
I listen for returning feet<br>
and voices at the door.
